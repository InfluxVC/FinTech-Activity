# FinTech-Activity
Who are you? what is your Background?
what are your career Goals?
Why did you choose FinTech as a career path?

My name is Manolo Serrano, I am 26 years old. I studied Music Production, and worked in the Automotive Industry as a Salesman for two years before getting promoted to Finance Manager.
My career goal is to have the skills necessary to always have a path, regardless of any Black Swan events that life can throw at us. The goal is to employ like minded professionals, have a business for cash flow and be able to invest more than 50% of my income to build Generational Wealth.
I chose FinTech as my career path because the skills required to be successful also correlate to better investment opportunities, budgeting skills, as well as organization and access to cutting edge research. From what I understand, the skills I will acquire throughout this career path will make me much more than just ‘employable’.
